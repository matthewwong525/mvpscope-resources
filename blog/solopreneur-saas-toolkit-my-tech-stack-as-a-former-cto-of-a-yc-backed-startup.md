Hi! My name is Matt. I'm a former CTO of a YC backed startup and I've built 2 apps in the past that have both generated over $10K USD of revenue.

Before moving onto my third startup, I wanted to take a step back, reflect on what I've done and create a good base for future startups. Which is why I've decided to write down my tech stack and create some boilerplate code for my future startups. I hope sharing this can help you build your startup!
